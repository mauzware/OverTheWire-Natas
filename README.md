Welcome to my [OverTheWire: Natas](https://overthewire.org/wargames/natas/) writeup archive. This series of challenges focuses on web security and HTTP, and offers a great step-by-step approach to learning web exploitation techniques.

All challenges were solved in a safe, legal, and educational environment. These write-ups are intended to help others learn, not to encourage misuse.

## Official Description

Natas teaches the basics of serverside web-security.

Each level of natas consists of its own website located at http://natasX.natas.labs.overthewire.org, where X is the level number. There is no SSH login. To access a level, enter the username for that level (e.g. natas0 for level 0) and its password.

Each level has access to the password of the next level. Your job is to somehow obtain that next password and level up. All passwords are also stored in /etc/natas_webpass/. 
E.g. the password for natas5 is stored in the file /etc/natas_webpass/natas5 and only readable by natas4 and natas5.
