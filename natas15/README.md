## üß† Walkthrough

- Access the site using credentials.

- We are still on SQLI section. Here, it's exactly the same as in the last level, just with more sanitization.

- You can try to find a right payload manually, but here I wrote a script for getting the password.

  ```
  $ python3 sqli-session.py                                                                                  
  Trying: a
  Trying: b
  Trying: c
  Trying: d
  Trying: e
  Trying: f
  Trying: g
  Trying: h
